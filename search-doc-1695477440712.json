Strings are just one pointer to the first character. The computer looks at the successive addresses and stops at the element \\0. It's important to know that when accessing uninitialized memory one can see values that have been saved by previous programs at that address. This can be dangerous, if there are passwords saved for example. One can check memory errors with valgrind on the command line. All this is important if one wants to make the program as efficient as possible and debug deep down.

We can either copy the array to a new location in memory with enough space, which requires some runtime, or we use a linked list where adding a new element is trivial, as the element after the last element is always reserved for a pointer to a potential new element. So if we have a constant length list, use a normal array, as the linked list would require more memory.

One can send information to any other point in that web. To achieve that, one needs the internet protocol (IP) to tell the routers where to send the information. TPC/UDP​ TPC is another protocol that helps with sending information to different programs of one IP address. It also allows sending large chunks of data in multiple parts. If the user has a bad connection certain parts can be sent again instead of all the parts. UDP is a protocol that allows sending large amounts of data, but it doesn't grantee delivery. This is useful for calls or other real time applications as one doesn't want to wait for new data, just to resend earlier data to get the perfect result. DNS​ When you type in a address in your web browser the computer and then your router somehow needs to know what IP address corresponds to the web address. This is done with DNS servers, which have huge lists which save these correspondences. So your router always first contacts a DNS server and gets a IP address back, which then can be used to contact the correct server to get the information one wants.

The robots are able to navigate and interact with each other on their own. The user can use VR to manipulate the environment, zoom in and out, and place walls in the environment to block or guide the robots. Additionally the robots can be picked up and placed in a new location. Leap Motion is used to identify the users motions. Thus the user can propose future actions or locations in the virtual environment and the robots will try to execute or move to them in the real world. The authors conducted a usability study with 10 participants between the ages 20 and 35 with an engineering background. Is showed that the controls are intuitive and the test missions are accelerated with the help of human intervention. They note however that some of the gestures, specifically the wall placement and the world resizing, need some training to get used to. https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/wp-content/uploads/whitney18.pdfhttps://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/pubs/vr_teleop.pdf controlling robots over the internet with VR (teleoperation)created interface to be used by other researcherscan be used with consumer-grade headsetstesting approach: https://cs.brown.edu/people/er35/publications/testing.pdf establishes baseline for other research https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01270.pdf control of robot arms in VRVR Control Roomhighlights collocation capabilities of VRpick, place, assembly, manufacturing taskssummary: In \\cite a team of researchers use VR to control a robot arm. The robot has two arms and is equipped with a camera at its &quot;head&quot;. The user uses the consumer-grade headset Oculus Rift CV1 and two Razer Hydra hand trackers as controllers. In VR the robot can then be controlled from a control room, which includes the view of the main camera and two optional views from the two robot arms. So the user feels as if they were in the robots head. To test the system, the authors made an expert user pick up and assemble a Lego piece. They compared it to an automated algorithm on the same task and were able to show that the human performed perfect, whereas the algorithm showed some weakness on the assembly. The user reported that the cameras in the robot arms helped with the alignment of the pieces. The teleoperation allows the user to perform actions from a save environment. The paper highlights the ability of VR to utilize consumer-grade hardware.

In \\cite the authors compare 3 interfaces. One egocentric, with a tiltable camera on the robots head, one exocentric, with the camera on the ceiling looking down, and the proposed method of using a mobile tablet as the camera. All three approaches use the tablets accelerometer to control the robots arms. The main advantage of the proposed method is, that its cameras field of view can reach all places, unlike the other two. The users can see an overlay over the workspace on the tablet screen, where the robots maximum range of motion and potential actions can be projected. When testing the system, users performed better on the pretrial, when having the AR plot enabled. Additionally the mobile reality interface shows better performance than the other two. The main points to take away, are that this approach needs visual markers in the environment, the user and the robot need to be in the same environment for the mobile version and the AR overlay helps the user and the robot interact better.

The robot was supposed to hit one of three holes in the wall in front of it with the electric screwdriver in their hand. The user is equipped with electrodes on their head and surface bar electrodes are applied to their forearms. The signals of those devices are processed separately and then used to determine the action of the robot arm. The user observes the robot and its environment directly and tries to move the tool in the robots hand via muscle movements. When the robot or the user themself make a mistake, the users brain reacts a certain way, often unconsciously, which can be detected by the EEG processor. Those signals are then used to stop and then correct the robot. The system was evaluated on 7 participants. The users were untrained, to reduce the hurdle for new users. The correct target was hit in roughly 70% of the trials, when the robot randomly chose. With the help of the correction through the participant, the success rate jumped to 97%. The authors concluded, that the reliability needs to be improved to be able to deploy the system in safety critical situations. Specifically, the neural network that classified the EEG signal into mistake or no-mistake, had only a 54% accuracy. They also highlight that more users would be needed to make the system more robust towards inter-person variations. However, the system shows potential for an effective supervision system. https://www.jmir.org/2019/10/e16194/ neuralink whitepaperuses brain signals to control a robotmight be interesting, but not used on humans yetdon't know if it &quot;counts&quot; as an examplemainly describes a way to get information out of the human brain, not however how to interpret it or control a robot.but really important https://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/329/658/emg_based_human_machine_interface_system.pdf example of using EMG to control a robotreally old paper ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Comparison​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Human Robot Interaction","url":"/blog/hri#comparison","content":"AR is the cheapest of the three, as no special hardware is needed most of the time.

But when comparing the more powerful Valve Index, to a more budget tablet, like the Galaxy Tab S8, VR devices are considerably more expensive than a basic AR device. Additionally for most VR headsets, an additional high end PC is necessary to process the visuals. Another alternative for AR are the Google Glasses, which come at a higher price, similar to the VR headsets. Bio-signal-based devices, specifically EEG, are starting at the price of a VR headset. They might however get cheaper if those devices get produced in higher numbers. The prices can get way higher as well, if implants through operations are used.

AR could have a huge jump in usability if it were to be integrated into everyday glasses or even contact lenses. This could enable people without training to use them. If robots are more common in everyday life this might increase the trust in the robots by displaying certain information about the robots future actions in the environment. Bio-signal-based technologies could be used to completely and reliably control robots with human thoughts, which would be a huge step in the field of human-robot interaction. If this technology is achieved, most other control devices might be obsolete.

Highlight the main contributions of the paper and its impact on the field of HRI interfaces: This paper compares some examples of the three technologies and their use cases. It also extrapolates those comparisons to the whole categories. Hopefully it can give some ideas on the future research directions of the field. Additionally, this is an encouragement to further investigate how to better compare the three technologies to then be able to better predict what technology is worth more efforts. To conclude this report, some recommendations for future research are the following. Discuss future directions for research in HRI interfaces, including VR, AR, and bio-signal-based: The final achievement would be to have a direct link between human and robot in both directions. Until then, all three technologies will need to be improved gradually. For VR, the ability to wear the headset for a long time and training programs should be the focus. AR might be more useful, if the technology gets integrated better into glasses to not need an extra tablet while working with a robot in the workspace. Bio-signal-based technologies first need to improve their reliability before they can be used in real-world applications. A next step would be to improve the designs behind the devices, so they can be used more for consumer products and accelerate the development.

Those could be shared and argued about. The program could help identifiy contentions between two peoples moral systems so one can instantly focus on the disagreements. The main issue is the uglieness of human input. Even with a some standard blocks like axioms and other logical forms humans still input their claims differently. So one would need some machine learning to interpret and compare arguments. With the advancements of language models like GTP-3 one may be able to achieve some decent results.
