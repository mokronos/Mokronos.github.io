The robot was supposed to hit one of three holes in the wall in front of it with the electric screwdriver in their hand. The user is equipped with electrodes on their head and surface bar electrodes are applied to their forearms. The signals of those devices are processed separately and then used to determine the action of the robot arm.\nThe user observes the robot and its environment directly and tries to move the tool in the robots hand via muscle movements. When the robot or the user themself make a mistake, the users brain reacts a certain way, often unconsciously, which can be detected by the EEG processor. Those signals are then used to stop and then correct the robot.\nThe system was evaluated on 7 participants. The users were untrained, to reduce the hurdle for new users. The correct target was hit in roughly 70% of the trials, when the robot randomly chose. With the help of the correction through the participant, the success rate jumped to 97%.\nThe authors concluded, that the reliability needs to be improved to be able to deploy the system in safety critical situations. Specifically, the neural network that classified the EEG signal into mistake or no-mistake, had only a 54% accuracy.
