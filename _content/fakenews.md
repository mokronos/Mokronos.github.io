## Google bias

### The Enduring Anti-Black Racism of Google Search

link: https://onezero.medium.com/the-enduring-anti-black-racism-of-google-search-d024924bff77

#### Bad article

A search engines job should be to get users the information they want. It feels like the baseline for zero bias is what the internet offers. So when the whole internet is nine images of an apple and one image of a banana, it would be good to expect an apple more often when searching for "fruit".

So when there are the tags for "black girls" are overwhelmingly found on porn sites it should be to no surprise that google shows those when searching for "black girls".

It feels like, if google would not intervene in the "societal" distribution of the search results, we would have more racist search results, as one can see at the exact example in the article. So to blame google instead of the culture of the people is wrong. So google actually does bias the results, however one could argue that that's a good thing. The author shouldn't blame google for the few times reality was shining through, but thank google for adjusting some bad baselines in society.

It might be helpful to get some diversification in the workplace to help these things, however those need not necessarily be engineers, as the manual adjustments shouldn't have anything to do with engineering, rather with social studies or ethics.

The whole thing is hard to evaluate since we don't exactly know how google selects the search results, however the alternatives are hard to imagine. Is the implication of the article that google engineers went ahead and weighted porn websites higher when searching for "black girls" instead of "white girls"? What would be the motive behind that?

#### Some weird quotes

> Pornography is a specific type of representation that denotes male power, female powerlessness, and sexual violence.

This feels wrong.

> Porn on the internet is an expansion of neoliberal capitalist interests. The web itself has opened up new centers of profit and pushed the boundaries of consumption. Never before have there been so many points for the transmission and consumption of these representations of Black women’s bodies, largely trafficked outside the control and benefit of Black women and girls themselves.

- Why is an expansion of capitalist interests bad?
- Isn't that good for a lot of people?
- What does neoliberalism have to do with it? 
- The assumption that the consumption is "largely" outside the benefit of black woman needs to be justified.
    - black woman that do porn do benefit? If they are exploited there is another question. (more fame, money, like music labels)
    - why only for black woman? And what about men in porn? (earn way less than woman)

### Gunn and Lynch Googling (2019)

Chapter 4, page 41-51

#### Risks of googling

- anonymity, no accountability of face-to-face information. Not a google issue, internet issue.
- no way to make sure that information is good, same issue in real life, but internet gives broader view quickly. One needs to check multiple sources, integrate in world view and check for inconsistencies.
- reductionism
    - reductionism: trust is earned not assumed
    - anti-reductionism: just trust others, assuming they have similar thinking faculties
- google searches lead to most wanted results, assumed to be right, because many others found it to be right
- trust if author is trusted, problematic, but not unique to internet
    - collective of authors (wikis)
    - some are automated (currency exchange)

#### selecting sources
- more reliable information is shared more, higher in ranking, good
- sometimes information of influencers does have popularity-because-popular, bad
- there are often experts on both sides, use institutional markers
- use of likes, upvotes, titles (must not necessarily be a good marker)
- advertising can be misleading
- Wikipedia can be good as everything needs source from expert, but can be outdated due to lag of checkups
- not all people are able to select "good" sources, most just accept everything google gives them first.

#### Google in Brain
- extend brain with chip, access fast amounts of information at speed of thought
- accelerates effects/issues above

## Wikipedia and the epistemology of testimony (by deborah perron tollefsen)

### Introduction

- studies mainly focus on individual testimony
- group testimony can't always be understood as just a summation of individual testimony
- the group itself testifies
- example Wikipedia

### Questions

- Is Wikipedia a source of testimony?
- What is the nature of that source?
    - the individuals that make entries
    - a subset of individuals
    - the entity Wikipedia itself
- How can we asses the trustworthiness of Wikipedia as such an unusual epistemic source?

### Are the statements on Wikipedia testimony?

#### define testimony
- conservative (Coady 1992)
    - speakers intention to present evidence on a specific matter in the interest of the audience
- liberal (E. Fricker 1995, Sosa 1991)
    - "tellings in general" with no restriction on the domain
- Jennifer Lackey (2006)
    - "S testifies that p by making an act of communication a if and only if (in part) in virtue of a’s communicable content, (1) S reasonably intends to convey the information that p, or (2) a is reasonably taken as conveying the information that p."
    - so it is a testimony if the speaker intends to convey information or if the audience takes it as such

All would obviously include Wikipedia as testimony.
