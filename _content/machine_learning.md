# Machine Learning

## Preparation
Going Through [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/spring/notes/0/) for refresh of some basics ([Notes]({% link _content/cs50.md %})).

## Problem description

> Find a model or procedure that makes best use of historical data comprised of inputs and outputs in order to skillfully predict outputs given new and unseen inputs in the future. [[1]](https://machinelearningmastery.com/think-machine-learning/#:~:text=Find%20a%20model%20or%20procedure%20that%20makes%20best%20use%20of%20historical%20data%20comprised%20of%20inputs%20and%20outputs%20in%20order%20to%20skillfully%20predict%20outputs%20given%20new%20and%20unseen%20inputs%20in%20the%20future.)

## Problem solution

> A model or procedure that automatically creates the most likely approximation of the unknown underlying relationship between inputs and associated outputs in historical data.

## How to get there

### Define the problem

- Describe problem informally and formally and list assumptions and similar problems
- List motivations for solving the problem, the benefits a solution provides and how the solution will be used.
- Describe how the problem could be solved manually.

### Prepare Data

- Consider what data is available, what data is missing and what data can be removed.
- Organize your selected data by formatting, cleaning and sampling from it.
- Transform preprocessed data into features ready for machine learning.

### Spot check algorithms

- create small experiment with different transformations of the dataset and different standard algorithms
- run every pair a bunch of times and compare mean and variance
- helps flushing out the problem structure and getting the algorithms on which to focus in the next steps

### Improving Results

- Search through parameter space to find best performing models
- Ensemble: combine results of multiple models

### Present Results

- Define the context of the problem and the motivation
- Describe Problem as a question that got answered
- Concisely describe the solution as an answer to the question
- Specify limitations of the model, what questions it can't answer and with what probability it can answer questions
